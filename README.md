Comprehensive Analyzing of Pricing System Performance of an Online Taxi App/Ride Sharing Through Real Dataset Using Python.

- Performed exploratory data analysis.
- Identifying patterns and testing significance to draw data-driven conclusions. 
- Generated origin-destination demand matrices to analyze overall travel demand and served demand. Identified the OD pair with the highest unmet demand percentage.
- Analyzed passenger and driver behavior through statistical tests on the effects of offered price on ride cancellations. Found significant effects at 95% confidence level.
- Compared driver ride rejection rates during peak and off-peak hours. Found significant difference in rejection likelihood. 
- Plotted price trends for rejected ride requests over different times of day. Used visualizations to identify patterns.
- Preprocessed data on fields like distance and offered price through techniques like normalization. Enabled effective downstream analysis.
- Extracted key demand metrics like total trip requests over 1-hour intervals. Visualized trends to reveal demand fluctuations. 
- Performed exploratory analysis to generate insights from real online taxi data. Identified opportunities to improve service pricing and availability.
